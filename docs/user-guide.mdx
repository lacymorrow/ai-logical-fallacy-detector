### Understanding Results

#### Fallacy Types

The detector identifies these common logical fallacies:

1. **Ad Hominem**
   - Attacking the person instead of their argument
   - Example: "You can't trust his economic analysis because he's never had a real job."

2. **Straw Man**
   - Misrepresenting an opponent's argument
   - Example: "She wants better healthcare, so she must want complete government control."

3. **False Equivalence**
   - Drawing invalid comparisons
   - Example: "Learning to ride a bike is just like learning quantum physics."

4. **Appeal to Authority**
   - Using authority as proof
   - Example: "This celebrity doctor says this diet is the best, so it must be."

5. **Slippery Slope**
   - Claiming one event leads to catastrophe
   - Example: "If we allow this small change, everything will fall apart."

6. **False Dichotomy**
   - Presenting only two options
   - Example: "Either you're with us or against us."

7. **Circular Reasoning**
   - Using conclusion to prove premises
   - Example: "This book is true because it says it's true."

8. **Hasty Generalization**
   - Drawing conclusions from insufficient evidence
   - Example: "I met two rude people from that city, so everyone there must be rude."

9. **Appeal to Emotion**
   - Using emotions instead of logic
   - Example: "Think of the children!"

10. **Red Herring**
    - Introducing irrelevant information
    - Example: "But what about that other issue?"

## Examples

### Example 1: Political Argument

```text
Input: "Senator Smith can't be trusted on economic policy because he's wealthy
and out of touch. If we follow his tax plan, everyone will end up poor and
the economy will collapse completely."

Analysis Results:
- Ad Hominem: "can't be trusted... because he's wealthy"
- Slippery Slope: "everyone will end up poor..."
```

### Example 2: Product Review

```text
Input: "This product must be great because a famous actor uses it. Either you
buy this brand or you don't care about quality. My friend tried a different
brand once and had a bad experience, so all other brands are terrible."

Analysis Results:
- Appeal to Authority: "must be great because a famous actor uses it"
- False Dichotomy: "Either you buy this brand or..."
- Hasty Generalization: "all other brands are terrible"
```
